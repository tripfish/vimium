#
# A mode implements a number of keyboard (and possibly other) event handlers which are pushed onto the handler
# stack when the mode is activated, and popped off when it is deactivated.  The Mode class constructor takes a
# single argument "options" which can define (amongst other things):
#
# name:
#   A name for this mode.
#
# keydown:
# keypress:
# keyup:
#   Key handlers.  Optional: provide these as required.  The default is to continue bubbling all key events.
#
# Further options are described in the constructor, below.
#
# Additional handlers associated with a mode can be added by using the push method.  For example, if a mode
# responds to "focus" events, then push an additional handler:
#   @push
#     "focus": (event) => ....
# Such handlers are removed when the mode is deactivated.
#
# The following events can be handled:
#   keydown, keypress, keyup, click, focus and blur

# Debug only.
